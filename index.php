                    <dd>There is no cost to a deceased donor's family for donating organs and tissues. All costs directly related to the organ donation are covered by the recipient's insurance.
Hospital expenses incurred before the donation of organs, in attempts to save the donor's life, remain the responsibility of the donor's family. Families are also responsible for expenses related to a donor's funeral.
